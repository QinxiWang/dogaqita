# Dogaqita Kaleidoscope
## What it's about

![TitleImg](https://github.com/QinxiWang/dogaqita/blob/master/ReadMeFiles/Kaleidoscope.png "Kaleidoscope showing the Space image that comes default!")

The Kaleidoscope is a webbased Kaleidoscope, offering six degrees of symmetry for images of the user's choice. Kaleidoscope primarily uses two javascript files, and the home.html file which displays the kaleidoscope. 

Current features include:
* Uploading images from the user's hard drive
* Downloading the image as a JPEG
* Animating the Kaleidoscope
* Switching images between a predefined set
* Playing music while animating the kaleidoscope
* PARTY MODE: a full screen auto-animating feature which is great for PARTIES

System Requirements:
* Access to a modern web browsers, currently we support the most current versions of Google Chrome, Mozzila Firefox, and Apple's Safari. **We do not plan on supporting Internet Explorer or Microsoft's Edge browsers**
* Mobile devices have not been tested but devices running on x86 should be compatible.
* We recommend that devices have at least 2GB of RAM, as animation and loading all the images can become resource intensive.
